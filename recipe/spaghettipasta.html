<h1>Spaghetti Pasta</h1>

<p>Here's an easy, quick recipe for spaghetti pasta that’s perfect for a college student on the go!</p>
<br>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>1 serving of spaghetti</strong>(about a handful, or 2 oz)</li>
	<li><strong>Salt</strong>(optional, for the water)<li>
	<li><strong>1 jar of your favorite pasta sauce</strong>(or microwaveable pasta sauce cup)</li>
	<li><strong>Grated Parmesan cheese</strong>(optional)</li>
	<li><strong>Olive oil or butter</strong>(optional)</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2><stong>Materials:</stong></h2>
<ul>
	<li>1 pot for boiling pasta</li>
	<li>1 strainer (optional, or use the pot lid)</li>
	<li>1 fork or tongs</li>
	<li>1 microwave-safe bowl (if using microwave sauce)</li>
	<li>Stovetop or electric burner
</ul>

<h2><strong>Steps:</strong></h2>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Boil Water:</strong>
		<ul>-Fill your pot with water (about 3/4 full).</ul>
		<ul>-Add a pinch of salt to the water if you like, to season the pasta.</ul>
		<ul>-Place the pot on the stovetop and turn the heat to high. Bring the water to a boil.
	</li>

	<Br>

	<li><strong>Cook the Spaghetti: </strong>
		<ul>-Once the water is boiling, add the spaghetti.</ul>
		<ul>-Stir the spaghetti so it doesn't stick together.</ul>
		<ul>-Let it cook for 8-10 minutes (check the package for exact cooking time). Stir occasionally to prevent it from sticking.</ul>
	</li>

	<br>

	<li><strong>Drain the Pasta:</strong>
		<ul>-Once the pasta is cooked (taste-test for softness), carefully drain the water using a strainer or by holding the pot lid against the pasta and pouring out the water.</ul>
		<ul>If you don't have a strainer, pour slowly and carefully to avoid spills.</ul>
	</li>

		<br>

	<li><strong>Heat the Sauce:</strong>
		<ul>-If you have pasta sauce, pour it into a microwave-safe bowl and heat it in the microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute until warm. Stir halfway through.</ul>
		<ul>-You can also add cold sauce directly to the hot pasta if you're in a rush—it will warm up quickly.</ul>
	</li>

	<br>

	<li><strong>Combine and Serve</strong>
		<ul>-Mix the warm sauce into your pasta.</ul>
		<ul>-Add olive oil or a small amount of butter for extra flavor, and sprinkle some Parmesan cheese on top (if desired).</ul>
	</li>

		<br>

	<li><strong>Quick Tips:</strong>
		<ul>-Time-saving hack: Buy pre-made microwaveable pasta sauce cups to save time.</ul>
		<ul>-Meal prep idea: Cook extra pasta and store it in the fridge for future meals.</ul>
		<ul>-Flavor boost: Add garlic powder or Italian seasoning for a more flavorful dish.</ul>
	</li>

</ul>
</ol>
