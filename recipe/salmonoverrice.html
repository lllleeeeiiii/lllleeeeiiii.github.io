<br>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>1 salmon filet</strong>(pre-cooked, canned, or microwavable for convenience)</li>
	<li><strong>1 cup of instant rice or pre-cooked rice</strong>(microwavable rice packets work too)<li>
	<li><strong>1/2 cup grapes (red or green),</strong>(optional)</li>
	<li><strong>Soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, or lemon juice</strong>((for flavor)
</li>
	<li><strong>Olive oil or butter</strong>(optional, for flavor)</li>
	<li><strong>Optional toppings</strong>steamed veggies, avocado, or sesame seeds</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2><stong>Materials:</stong></h2>
<ul>
	<li>1 microwave-safe bowl or rice cooker (for cooking rice)</li>
	<li>1 microwave-safe plate or pan (if using stovetop)</li>
	<li>1 fork or spatula</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Steps:</strong></h2>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Cook the Rice:</strong>
		<ul>-Microwave Option: If using microwavable rice, follow the instructions on the packet (usually around 1-2 minutes in the microwave).</ul>
		<ul>Instant Rice Option: If using instant rice, combine 1 cup of instant rice and 1 cup of water in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 1-2 minutes (or follow the directions on the package). Let it sit for 1 minute.</ul>
	</li>

	<Br>

	<li><strong>Prepare the Salmon:</strong>
		<ul>-Microwavable Salmon: If you have a microwavable salmon fillet, place it on a microwave-safe plate, season with salt and pepper (optional), and heat it according to the package (usually 1-2 minutes).</ul>
		<ul>-Canned Salmon: Drain the can and add the salmon directly to the cooked rice.</ul>
		<ul>-Pre-cooked or Pan-Seared Salmon: If you have access to a stove, quickly heat the salmon in a pan over medium heat with a little olive oil or butter for 2-3 minutes on each side.</ul>
	</li>

	<br>

	<li><strong>Combine the Salmon and Rice:</strong>
		<ul>-Once the rice is cooked, place the salmon fillet (or canned salmon) on top of the rice.</ul>
		<ul>-Drizzle soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, or lemon juice over the salmon and rice for flavor.</ul>
		<ul>-Optionally, add a little olive oil or butter for extra richness.</ul>
		</li>

		<br>

	<li><strong>Add Toppings (optional):</strong>
		<ul>-If you have some quick veggies (like microwavable frozen veggies), you can steam them and add them on top for a balanced meal.</ul>
		<ul>-Avocado slices or a sprinkle of sesame seeds are also great add-ons for extra texture and flavor.</ul>
	</li>

	<br>

	<li><strong>Quick Tips:</strong>
		<ul>-Pre-cooked salmon packets: These are available at most grocery stores and make this recipe even faster.</ul>
		<ul>-Microwavable rice cups: Another huge time-saver, since they take just a minute to heat up.</ul>
		<ul>-Meal prep: Cook extra rice and store it in the fridge for quick meals later.</ul>
