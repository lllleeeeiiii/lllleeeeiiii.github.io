	<li>1/2 ripe avocado</li>
	<li>1 egg (scrambled, fried, or boiled)</li>

	<li>Small bowl (for mashing avocado)</li>
	<li>Fork (for mashing the avocado)</li>

	<li>Oven-safe ramekin or dish (for cooking a fried egg in the air fryer)</li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps:</h2>

	<li><strong>Prepare the Eggs:</strong>
		<ul><strong>Fried or scrambled egg (air fryer):</strong></ul>
		<ul>-For a fried egg, crack the egg into a small oven-safe dish or ramekin and place it in the air fryer at 350F for 5-6 minutes until the white is set.</ul>
		<ul><strong>Microwave:</strong></ul>
		<ul>- For scrambled eggs, whisk the egg in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 30 seconds, then stir and cook for another 30 seconds until fluffy.</ul>

	<li><strong>Mash the Avocado:</strong>
		<ul>-Once the eggs are almost done, place a slice of cheese on top of each egg. Cover the pan for a minute to help the cheese melt.</ul></li>
